          <h3>1. Who We Are</h3>
          <p>
            NextWave AI Suite (“NextWave”, “we”, “our”, “us”) is an independent software and app development studio
            that creates educational, productivity, and AI-powered applications for mobile and web platforms.
          </p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy applies to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>All apps published under NextWave AI Suite</li>
            <li>All Android apps distributed via :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</li>
            <li>All websites operated under nextwaveaisuite.com</li>
            <li>Any future apps or services released by NextWave AI Suite</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Our Privacy Principles</h3>
          <p>We design our apps with privacy-first principles, meaning:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We collect only what is necessary</li>
            <li>We avoid personal data wherever possible</li>
            <li>We do not sell user data</li>
            <li>We do not build advertising profiles</li>
            <li>We comply with Google Play policies, child safety rules, and data minimisation standards</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Information We Collect</h3>
          <p><strong>a) Information You Provide</strong></p>
          <p>Most NextWave AI Suite apps do not require user accounts.</p>
          <p>If an app includes optional support or contact features, we may collect:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Email address (only if you contact us)</li>
            <li>Support messages or feedback you voluntarily submit</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This information is used only to respond to your request.</p>

          <p><strong>b) Automatically Collected Information</strong></p>
          <p>Some apps may collect limited, non-identifiable technical data, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Device type and OS version</li>
            <li>App version</li>
            <li>Crash reports and performance data</li>
            <li>Country or region (approximate only)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This data is used strictly for app stability, bug fixes, and performance improvements.</p>

          <h3>4. Data We Do Not Collect</h3>
          <p>Across our apps, we do not intentionally collect:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Names or real-world identity details</li>
            <li>Phone numbers or addresses</li>
            <li>Precise GPS location</li>
            <li>Contacts, photos, or media files</li>
            <li>Religious, political, or health profiling</li>
            <li>Sensitive personal data</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>5. Advertising & Monetisation</h3>
          <p><strong>Advertising ID</strong></p>
          <p>
            Unless explicitly stated in an app’s store listing: our apps do not use the Android Advertising ID and we do not
            serve personalised ads. If an app ever includes ads or monetisation features, the store listing and in-app
            disclosures will clearly state this.
          </p>

          <h3>6. Children & Family Safety</h3>
          <p>Some NextWave AI Suite apps may be suitable for children or families. When applicable:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Apps do not include chat, messaging, or social features</li>
            <li>No personal data is knowingly collected from children</li>
            <li>No user-generated content is allowed</li>
            <li>We follow Google Play’s Families and Children policies where required</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>7. Third-Party Services</h3>
          <p>Our apps may rely on trusted platform services such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Google Play Console (distribution, crash reporting, performance metrics)</li>
            <li>Hosting and infrastructure providers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These services operate under their own privacy and security policies.</p>

          <h3>8. Data Security</h3>
          <p>
            We take reasonable technical and organisational steps to protect data against unauthorised access, misuse or
            disclosure, loss, or destruction. No system is 100% secure, but we follow best-practice safeguards.
          </p>

          <h3>9. Data Retention & Deletion</h3>
          <p>
            We retain data only for as long as necessary to provide app functionality and meet technical or legal requirements.
            You may request deletion of any personal data by contacting us.

          <h3>11. Changes to This Policy</h3>
